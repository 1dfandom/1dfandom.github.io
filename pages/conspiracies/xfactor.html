                <p>Eleanor Jane Calder is a graduate from the University of Manchester, where she earned a degree in Sociology. She is an Assistant Stylist and formerly worked as a fashion blogger. She originally dated Louis Tomlinson from September 2011 to March 2015. They reunited in January 2017.</p>
                <p>In the peak of One Direction, shippers of <a href="larry.html">Larry Stylinson</a> started a conspiracy theory that Calder was a character and beard created by One Direction's management in order to dispel rumors of homosexual relationships within the band in order to keep a more marketable image.</p>

            <div><img src="/assets/imgs/triplets.jpg"></div>
            <div>
                <p>This conspiracy suggested that Eleanor Calder, though certainly a real person, was simply an actress and had no real romantic ties to Tomlinson. Additionally, she had a sister Christina Calder who would occassionally substitute in for her role as Tomlinson's girlfriend. This eventually evolved even further, insisting that there was yet another Calder sister named Gretchen, who too would sometimes make public appearances as Eleanor when needed.</p>
            </div>
            <div><img src="/assets/imgs/triplets2.jpg"></div>
            <div>
                <p> Much of the evidence for this theory comes for an extremely misogynistic lense, as Larries would nitpick every physical attribute of Eleanor's and claim inconsistencies, thus "proving" that she was a different person, and therefore must be one of her supposed fraternal twins. Some attributes that Larries would target would be her smile,  hairline, nose, height, face shape, and weight. </p>
