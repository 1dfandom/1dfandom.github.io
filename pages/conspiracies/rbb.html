                <p>Rainbow Bondage Bear (RBB) found its way into 1D lore during the 2015 Where We Are Tour when a fan had thrown a rainbow Build-A-Bear onto the stage during one of the shows. Someone took the bear and kept it, only being revealed to have been kept when it showed up on social media says later now covered in electrical tape (carried by tour crew) in a fashion that resembled bondage gear. Thus, Rainbow Bondage Bear was born. </p>
                <img src="/assets/imgs/rbbsbb.jpg">
                    <p>Whoever had the bear created a Twitter account for the bear, posting anthropomorphized tweets showing RBB's shenannigans throughout tour. This account was advertised to the crowds during shows with the message "follow @bodagebear1d". The account began just showing RBB doing random things, but soon spiraled into making references to gay pop culture such as icons like Judy Garland. The account soon later got suspended.</p>
                <img src="/assets/imgs/rbb.png">
                <p>RBB returned when the band's last tour, the On The Road Again Tour where the bear would show up in funny and cute little outfits, sitting somewhere near the stage. Occassionally, RBB would dress like Freddie Mercury - another queer icon.</p>
            </div>
            <div><img src="/assets/imgs/rbbfreddie.jpg"></div>
            <div>
                <p>Eventually, a second, smaller bear had shown up with RBB and from that point on, the two were inseparable.</p>
            </div>
            <div><img src="/assets/imgs/rbbsbbfirst.png"></div>
            <div>
                <p>At this point in time, fans had collectively come to know the bears as Rainbow Bondage Bear and Sugar Baby Bear. Every show, they would dress up in new, cute little costumes. However, this would come to snowball as the outfits would become more elaborate and more accessories would be put on them. The bears would be shown reading queer literature and refer to <a href="larry.html">Larry,</a> as most things do within the 1D fandom.</p>
