            <h1 class="larry">Larry Stylinson</h1></div>
            <div><p>Larry Stylinson, a portmanteau of Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson, is the pairing name for the most popular ship in One Direction fandom. This ship is notorious even outside of 1D fandom for the faction of Larry shippers (also known as "Larries") who believe that Harry and Louis are secret boyfriends in real life. These beliefs were fueled by the fact that Harry and Louis were best friends and extremely close - they lived together, interacted a lot on social media, and were playfully affectionate with one another publicly, particularly on stage and in interviews. Their family members, such as Harry's mother Anne Twist, also played into the Larry ship as they would joke about the two being married.</p></div>

            <div><p>At the peak of One Direction, Harry and Louis were also aware that fans were shipping them together, as they explained the Larry portmanteau in interviews, and may have played up their friendship early on. This however came to an abrupt halt as the "shipping" within the fandom grew far too extreme around 2012 and 2013, as many Larries continued to the the overstep boundaries with Harry, Louis, and their respective loved ones. Some examples include Larries attacking Louis's several girlfriends, beliving them to be "beards" hired by Modest Management to quell homosexuality and in-band relationship rumors. This particularly affected Louis's longtime on-and-off girlfriend, Eleanor Calder, and resulted in another conspiracy theory: <a href="/pages/conspiracies/calder-triplets.html" class="larrylink">The Calder Triplets.</a></p></div>
            <div><img src="/assets/imgs/larry2.gif"></div>
            <div><p>Harry and Louis, who once were notoriously the closest of the five boys, were very rarely seen to touch each other (or even stand next to each other) until 2015 when fans started reporting excitedly that they seemed to have relaxed slightly. Nevertheless, Larries continues to shout their praises of Larry, desperately searching for more evidence and proof that Larry was and is real. To this day, there are thousands of Larries who analyze anything Harry and Louis post or are involved with to add to their collection of "evidence" in the smallest of details.</p></div>
