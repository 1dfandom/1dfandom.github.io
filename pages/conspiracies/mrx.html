                <p>The Mr.X scare began the night of December 3, 2012: One Direction's first performance at Madison Square Garden in New York City. At the time, this was the boys' biggest show they had ever played and integral moment in their career, so certainly the energy within the fandom was high. Fans across the world were excited to see the major achievement the band was about to obtain, until ominous messages spread via the public online chatroom Omegle started to spread. </p>

            <div>
                <p>"Mr. X" was an anonymous being who had spoken in riddles, hinting at a major tragedy occuring at the MSG show. The tragedy would affect the band, their families, the fans, and most specifically, Harry. Mr. X claimed that "one will fall" - who that one was had remained a mystery until a later encounter that hinted at Styles (see below).</p>

            <div>
                <p>Mr. X made many claims with ties to other conspiracies such as <a href="larry.html" class="mrxlink">Larry</a>, which obviously made it a huge point of interest for the One Direction fandom. The story spread like wildfire throughout social media, with fans genuinely concerned for the safety of the band members to the point that many contected authorities and attempted to inform the FBI of the threats being posed to the band. Many fans promised to protect Styles despite being young children, trending the hashtag "#HarryBeCareful". Ultimately, nothing was proven to have happened to planned to have happen and the show went all according to plan with no safety concerns or scares for the venue and security beyond standard  protocol.</p>
